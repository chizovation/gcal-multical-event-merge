Privacy Policy and Permission Justification

Single Purpose Description:
This extension's single purpose is to visually merge duplicate events that appear across multiple Google Calendars into a single, unified event display. This makes it easier for users to view events that are shared across multiple calendars without the visual clutter of duplicate entries.

Permission Justifications:

1. Content Script Matches (calendar.google.com, www.google.com/calendar):
- The extension only needs to run on Google Calendar pages to modify their visual display
- No additional host permissions are required as we only modify the page content
- No data is collected or transmitted outside of the Google Calendar interface

2. Storage Permission:
- Used solely to store the user's preference for whether the extension is enabled or disabled
- No personal or calendar data is stored
- This setting persists across browser sessions for user convenience

3. Remote Code:
- The extension does not execute any remote code
- All code is packaged within the extension
- The only external resources loaded are from Google Calendar itself

Data Usage Compliance:
- This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information
- No data is shared with third parties
- The extension only modifies the visual presentation of calendar events locally in the browser
- All operations are performed client-side
- No analytics or tracking code is included

This extension complies with all Chrome Web Store developer program policies and data usage requirements.
